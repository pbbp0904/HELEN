# RDP-Environmental
This is a PCB designed in KiCad for the UAH SHC HELEN project's Radiation Detection Payload (RDP). This board is intended to gather environmental inupt including temperature, pressure and GPS.  This information is processed and saved and potentially shared with an external FPGA.
