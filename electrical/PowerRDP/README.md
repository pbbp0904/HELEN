# RDP-Power
This is a PCB designed in KiCad for the UAH SHC HELEN project's Radiation Detection Payload (RDP).  This PCB is intended to receive power from 2-3 18650 battery "banks" with 2 batteries connecting to each of J1:6.  Then the voltage is stepped to appropriate levels for the power requirements of the RDP payload (+/-15V, +12V and +3.3V).  A BOM will be attached after a parts list is fully compiled.

The rendering above is a rough idea of what this payload will look like with most of its components installed.  It is only missing the +/-15 V regulator in the bottom right and the mounting screws.
